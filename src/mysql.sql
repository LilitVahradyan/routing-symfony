The companys tools are taking aim at software development teams working on web apps using the React javascript framework, but the longer term goal is to include mobile app design, as well. Pochtar says that the previous approaches to solving this problem have suffered because they have tried to combine two vastly different ways of thinking â€” user interface design and coding. By building a full-fledged design editor and code interface, they believe they have created a tool that respects the requirements of both.',

 'While there is a spectacular range of backend development technologies out there, including the likes of Zend, Symfony, Python, and Lumen, Node.js stands out among the rest. Node.js is not just a framework, it is a complete JavaScript environment, equipped with all the tools a developer may need.

Node.js outshines other web applications by replacing web sockets with revolutionary push technology. The purpose behind Node.js is to use non-blocking and event-driven input/output so that it remains lightweight and efficient against real-time applications, even with a large amount of data running on distributed devices. It is essentially an application that enables real-time, two-way connections, where both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely.',

Float-based layouts have mostly been replaced with Flexbox in modern websites. But, thats not to say this chapter isnt worth reading. For over a decade, floats served as the foundation for the majority of websites on the Internet, which means youll definitely encounter them at some point in your career.',
